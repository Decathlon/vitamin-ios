## Switch
[Reference](https://www.decathlon.design/726f8c765/p/99628d-toggle/b/067acb)

Vitamin provides a `VitaminSwitch` class which handles specific colors for "on" and "off" states.

```swift
import Vitamin

// This switch will have a blue "on" state, and a gray "off" state
let vitaminSwitch = VitaminSwitch()
```

Since it is a direct subclass of standard `UISwitch`, it can be used exactly like this one.
